301  =To cross the ball, press la when you are deep in opposition territory.
Follow the on-screen guides when crossing the ball to ensure that the ball goes between the cones.
Once the cross comes in, press lc to meet it with a first-time shot. Now, can you do all this within the time limit?
302  =Press la to cross
Followed by lc to take a first-time shot
303  =Press lb to play a low pass.
To direct your pass, push ob in the desired direction.
Your task is to pass the ball to the highlighted player 10 consecutive times while making sure that the opposition players don't get the chance to intercept. Can you do all this within the time limit?

326  =When shooting, push ob in the desired direction to take aim.
Next, press and hold lc to adjust power level.
By shooting before the power gauge builds up, you can shoot for accuracy at the expense of power. 
Similarly, shooting once the power gauge has built up will result in a more powerful shot, but at the expense of accuracy.
Hold lj to display the target on screen.
Pushing ob too far or building up the power gauge excessively, results in a larger target area which ultimately reduces your accuracy.
Your objective is to take out all 6 panels by adjusting both the direction and the power of your shots.

341  =To go for the delicate chip over the goalkeeper, press lc while holding li.

378  =Familiarise yourself with the newly introduced advanced shooting controls.
379  =Advanced shooting controls use both  ob and lc just as you do in Basic shooting controls. The only major difference is that in the case of the former, you will see a target shown on screen.
You only need to hold lc briefly if you want to put placement over power when shooting and similarly you can sacrifice accuracy for increased power if you hold lc for longer.
Press lc to display the target on your screen and use ob to control both the direction and elevation. Going for the corners will make it harder for the keeper to save, but at the same time it will decrease your own chances of hitting the target.
