This is particularly useful when you are trying to receive the ball in a crowded area.
228  =To flick the ball up as soon as you trap it, you will need to press and hold jl prior to receiving the ball.
This is a skill which has many applications. It could be used as a means of escaping a marker who is coming in from behind when receiving the ball or as a means to set up a powerful strike.
229  =To turn towards the opposing goal as you trap the ball, release ob, then hold lk prior to receiving the ball.
230  =To trick an opponent into thinking you are going to receive the ball, release ob, then hold li and lj before the ball gets to your feet. If there is an unmarked player who is running in behind you, you can use this trick to create confusion among the defense, which can then be exploited.

236  =To cross the ball, press la when you are on the ball in a wide position.
To hit a low cross along the ground, quickly press la twice. For a high cross, press la while holding lk.
237  =If you are running with the ball and looking to exploit the space between the opposition goalkeeper and his defence, try hitting an early cross by pressing la while holding li.
238  =Press lc to shoot. The longer you hold lc, the greater the elevation. Accuracy and power when shooting can also be influenced by factors such as the speed you are running when shooting on the run or the distance of the run up you took before striking the ball.
239  =If you need additional accuracy when shooting press lc while holding lk.
Controlled shots sacrifice power for accuracy, but tend to be harder for goalkeepers to save.
240  =To go for a delicate chip, press lc while holding li.
If you see that the goalkeeper is off his line, try lobbing the ball over his head and into an empty net.

The longer you hold lb, the further the ball will travel.
258  =Press ld while the goalkeeper has the ball in his hands to make him throw it into open space.
The longer you hold ld, the further the ball will travel.
259  =Press la while the goalkeeper has the ball in his hands to make him kick it up the pitch.
The longer you hold la, the further the ball will travel.
260  =Press lb just as the goalkeeper is about to kick or throw the ball to make him fake a pass.
261  =To instruct your teammates to attack, you must first use jn to select the player who will receive the ball.

314  =When facing a penalty, you can adjust the goalkeeper's position by pushing ob toward the desired direction up to the moment the penalty kick taker strikes the ball.
315  =A goalkeeper stands a decent chance of saving a powerfully struck penalty if you guess right by pushing ob in the direction you want before the ball is struck. However, this technique doesn't work so well against penalty takers who deliberately take weak shots to disrupt your rhythm and make you commit early.
316  =A player may sometimes choose to go for placement over power when taking a penalty. In such cases, the keeper can quite comfortably pull off a save by pushing ob to dive after the ball has been struck. However, this doesn't work well against powerful strikes where committing early is the key to making a save.
317  =When an opponent who is chasing you tries to get a grab of you, push jn in his direction to spread your arms and hold him off.
318  =Quickly tap lf twice to perform a tackle on an opposition player.
