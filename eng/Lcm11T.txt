272  =It looks like he's got a high opinion of himself. He's asking for a lot of money.

377  =Paying his release clause fee means we won't have to negotiate a price with his club.
378  =The option to buy has been removed from the loan agreement.
379  =We're satisfied with the proposed conditions.
380  =To be honest, this deal is not all that good and not all that bad.
381  =We're nearly there, but my guy is looking for a few more incentives to get behind the deal. Know what I mean?

415  =About the option to buy, do you see a way for us to come to a fairer agreement than the current one?
416  =How much wiggle room do you have on the transfer fee?
417  =The transfer fee is just too low. We can't accept this evaluation.
418  =The transfer fee offer doesn't come close to our expectations. Right now I don't see us doing this deal.
419  =The transfer for %1$s|comes with aSelling On Option to pay%3$s| to %2$s|.
