If the conditions are not met, you will need to spend GP or myClub Coins to extend their contract.
331  =You can use the myClub Coins you've acquired to sign a highly skilled Top Agent. Go ahead and give it a try.
332  =There is another way of building a talented squad.
This is known as TRAINING.
Let's give it a try!
333  =Let's try converting a player into a EXP Trainer.
To get started, select myClub MEMBERS and open the Members List.
334  =Select %s, press ka to display a sub-menu, then select Convert into a EXP Trainer.
335  =You will convert this player into a EXP Trainer. Once this has been done, you will not be able to include him on your squad.
Are you sure you want to proceed?
336  =%s has been added to the Trainer List. 
Now, let's use this EXP Trainer to do some TRAINING with your players.
337  =Select TRAINING.
Then, display the Trainer List.
338  =Select a EXP Trainer from the list.
339  =This EXP Trainer has a lot in common with %s. 
This means they should have a high level of affinity.
340  =This high level of affinity is very important, because it has a big influence on the effectiveness of the training.
Be sure to keep an eye on whether or not trainers and players have a lot in common.

Now, time to start TRAINING by pushing ka!
341  =Thanks to the high level of affinity he has with the EXP Trainer, this player has improved dramatically!
Let's check out the results of his training.
342  =Now, let's take a look at team chemistry.

All managers have their own Preset Tactics, and for each set of Preset Tactics, there are Team Instructions. Each player will also have his own favoured Team Instructions.

The better the match between the Team Instructions of the manager and the players, the better the chemistry between them and the resulting tactical strength of the team.

As players get used to instructions with match experience, they'll become more adept at following the manager's Team Instructions.
343  =When Team Spirit is low, players cannot perform at their best.
To boost Team Spirit, try assembling a group of players who fit the Manager's tactics.
Note that when you change the Manager, Team Spirit will be low for a while as they get used to their new boss.
If you keep changing the Manager too often, you won't see your players at their best.
344  =Each of your players has a contract which determines the number of games they can play for you.
You can keep hold of players even after their contracts have expired, but you cannot select them for matches.
Contracts can be renewed from the jfPlayer Menu.
345  =This is the Squad screen where you set up the basic tactics known as Main (Offensive).
There are also Squad screens for Sub (Defensive) and Sub (Offensive) tactics.
You can switch between these three screens at any time using ji and jj.
During a match, you can view these screens by selecting Auto change Preset Tactics.
346  =On the Sub (Defensive) and Sub (Offensive) screens, by deploying a Manager as an Assistant Coach, you can have a variety of different tactics.

You have been given a Manager as a gift,
so go to Sub (Defensive) and set aManager as an Assistant Coach.

Select your Manager from the following list.
347  =You will now set the manager you just acquired, %s, as an Assistant Coach. First of all, switch the Squad screen to Sub (Defensive).
Press jh to display the second page.
348  =You are now viewing your Sub (Defensive) Preset Tactics. Place the cursor over Manager and press jf.
Select Changing Managers from the Manager Menu, to change the Manager assigned to this Squad.
349  =%s has now been assigned as an Assistant Coach for Sub (Defensive). Let's not forget about Sub (Offensive), though. Up to three people's tactics can be used during one match.
What's more, when a Manager has been set as a Assistant Coach, their contract will not run down, so be sure to make good use of this function.
350  =Now, press jg to return to Main (Offensive).
351  =In Sub (Defensive), each Assistant Coach uses defensive Team Instructions. Be aware of your Squad's characteristic when choosing a Manager to use as an Assistant Coach.
352  =Finally, don't forget that pressing jc brings up team-related menus, while jf brings up player and Manager-related menus. If you have any questions about management, be sure to let me know.
353  =Well, that's the end of the basic Squad Management tutorial.
For more details on various features, refer to the help that's available from the Main Menu by pressing ja.
Try to make sure you have a good grasp on the game's features and rules!
354  =Enter negotiations with up to three Scouts to try and find a player that's more suitable for your requirements.
355  =In the Members List, you can select a player with ka and press jc to display a menu giving you various options.
If you have selected multiple players, some menu options will be unavailable.
356  =Next, let's look at some important points to consider when registering a player in a Squad.

Each player has various Costs, based on their ability.
The more talented a player is, the higher these costs become.
A Squad's combined player Costs are known as the team's Total Costs.
357  =If Total Costs exceed the Management Skills of your Manager, then Team Spirit will plummet.
To get the best out of a team of great players, you will need to sign a Manager with high Management Skills.
358  =Let's start TRAINING with %s.
359  =If you start TRAINING, the EXP Trainer will no longer be able to play for you. 
Make sure you have a thorough understanding of your team's situation and a clear plan before starting TRAINING.
360  =You can pay by either GP or myClub Coins.

395  =Let's move to the "SQUAD MANAGEMENT" menu.
396  =%s has been signed on loan.
He has a contract for %d games. Please be aware that this contract cannot be extended and that he cannot be used in a Competition.
397  =We're about to introduce features that experienced myClub players will be familiar with.
Would you like to skip to the explanations of the new features?
398  =We're about to explain important myClub features.

404  =How did the match go?

Acquiring top-quality players is the easiest way to build a strong team.

By spending myClub Coins, you can employ skilled agents.
Now, let's try using a Special Agent.
405  =You will request training for %s, a player on loan. Once the training is complete, the EXP Trainer will leave the club.

Are you sure you want to start training this loanee?
406  =Next, let's select the club that will serve as the basic template for your team.
You will use the emblem and kit of the team you select.
407  =Within the same Squad, you can have 3 different Preset Tactics each registered with a different manager, giving you 3 separate tactical options.
To learn more about using this function, choose "Help" with ja in Squad Management.

409  =A Scout that allows you to sign players with this characteristic:

413  =Each Manager has his own preferred Team Instructions.
The same applies to players.

When a player's preference matches the Manager's, a "link" icon will flash. The more of these "links" a player has with a Manager, the higher their level of affinity.
