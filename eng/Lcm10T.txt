1    =We should be challenging for trophies every year. I don't care if it's the league, domestic cup or na, take your pick. Now get it done.
2    =I want to see us qualify for the %s this year. This takes priority over every other competition. Got it?
3    =I've decided our main goal for the season. I want you to take us to the knockout stages of the %s.
4    =We need to qualify for the UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE or the UEFA EUROPA LEAGUE this year.
5    =Your job is to finish in the top %d of the league this season. You can make that happen, right?
6    =Whatever happens this season, I want you to make sure we stay in the top division. You can do that for me, can't you?
7    =We're aiming to finish high up the table this year. Make a top-%d finish a reality for me. Got it?
8    =I think we've just about outgrown this division. By the end of the season I want to see us promoted.
9    =You're going to love it at %s. I've got a good feeling you're going to do wonders here.
10   =Pre-season competitions are always a good test of where we stand. I can't wait to see the new approach you've got in store for the coming season.
11   =The %s is a top trophy target for this season. Get us as close to the silverware as you can.
12   =I want us to win every title we're going for. Yes, that means the %s too.
13   =The nc is a great legacy for our club to be a part of. Make sure it's ours this year.
14   =Well, the league is finally about get underway. We've got a long season ahead, but I want us to start as we mean to go on-by winning!
15   =You don't need me to tell you this, but the outcome of this playoff match has huge implications for next season. Make sure we win it.
16   =The %s is an important competition for this club. Steer us safely past the group stages, okay?
17   =Each victory takes us one step closer to glory. Make sure we make it past the %s Semi-finals.
18   =This club is hugely grateful to you for bringing us this far. But now's not the time to rest on our laurels. Take this club to the final of the %s.
19   =This is the biggest match of the year by a country mile. I want that %s winner's trophy and all the glory that comes with it. Do it for the club and the fans!
20   =We're one win away from the %s final. I don't expect it to be easy, but I've faith you can get us there.
21   =The %s trophy is a perennial target for this club. Now go and get it for us.
22   =Only the world's top teams make it to the %s. Can you imagine what it would do for this club to win it?
23   =There's nothing like a derby match against %s. The club and the fans expect at least a draw at home, no matter how well the other team is playing.
24   =I won't mince my words. I want to see us beat %s whatever. Make sure it happens.
25   =I know form doesn't mean much in derby matches against %s, but we're the superior football club. Let's make sure there's no upset today, eh?
26   =Admittedly %s are no walk in the park, but at least a draw is within our capabilities, right?
27   =Going up against %s will be a true test of our skills. They're no pushovers, but I expect us to come out on top in the end.
28   =There's no doubt we're favourites to beat %s today. That's why we need to avoid anything but a win.
29   =We've lost %d league matches on the trot. This can't continue. Make sure we win the next one.
30   =%d losses in a row in the league... We need to turn this slump around. Win the next one.
31   =We have to address this %d-match losing streak in the league. We need to find a win from somewhere.
32   =Are you happy with losing %d straight league games? Because I'm not! You're really testing my patience.
33   =This %d-match losing streak in the league has got to end. Make sure we win the next one, okay?
34   =Another win in the league and that's %d on the bounce. I've got faith in you to do it.
35   =It's not often I'm in such a good mood. I guess the possibility of a %d-match win streak in the league will do that to an owner!
36   =The season is really living up to my expectations. Let's see if we can take our win streak in the league to %d matches.
37   =Right, here's my top objective for this season. I want to see a winner's trophy in my office for either the league, domestic cup or na. Got that?
38   =I've got my eye on one prize and one prize only. I want this club to earn a berth in the %s. Any questions?
39   =Here's the itch this club needs you to scratch. Get us into the knockout stage of the %s. Savvy?
40   =Make this club proud to have you as its manager. Get us a place in either the UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE or UEFA EUROPA LEAGUE. You can do that, right?
41   =Here are your marching orders for this season. We need a top-%d finish in the league. Thanks.
42   =I've got one wish I want granted this season. Make sure we stay in the top division. Good luck.
43   =Every manager needs an owner to set his seasonal goals. I want this club breathing in top division air by next season. You can deliver that, right?
44   =Well, you did it. The club achieved its ambitions for the season. You've made me one very satisfied owner.
45   =You achieved our goal for the season and got us into the %s. Good work!
46   =You only went and made it happen! We're in the Knockout Phase of the %s. Thank you.
47   =Securing us a place in the %s was what I ordered, and you delivered. I can't thank you enough.
48   =So we finished in the top %d in the league, just like I asked. You've made this owner very happy indeed.
49   =I can't thank you enough for keeping us in the top flight for another season. Cheers.
50   =You did it, all right. We've been promoted to the top league. It doesn't get much better than this, eh?
51   =So we finished the season without a trophy or title. A bitter, bitter shame.
52   =Failing to secure a place in the %s is a tough pill to swallow. I'm disappointed.
53   =We didn't make it to the Knockout Phase of the %s like I requested at the start of the year. Shame.
54   =No nb football for us next season. Were there any silver linings, because I can't see any?
55   =We didn't secure a top-%d finish in the league this year. I can't help feeling we could have achieved so much more.
56   =Well, wave goodbye to this division because we've been relegated. I expected much better from you this season, if I'm being honest.
57   =So it's another season languishing down in this division instead of where we should be. I'd hoped you'd rise to the challenge and get us promoted.
58   =How's that new signing looking? I'm sure he'll prove to be a valuable addition to the squad.
59   =Great result in the %s. I've got a good feeling about this season.
60   =Grabbing the %s title was a stellar step in the right direction. The team is over the moon.
61   =It's one victory, but certainly a big one for the club. nc champions. Well done!
62   =We're off to a great start in what will be a gruelling season. Keep it up.
63   =We're on our way up the leagues, finally! And it's all thanks to you! We're celebrating tonight!
64   =That's the first big obstacle overcome. Good job in getting the club into the %s Knockout Phase.
65   =We're through to the %s Semi-finals. You can almost reach out and touch that silverware!
66   =You did it... You really did it. We're into the %s Final! I couldn't be happier!
67   =Incredible! We've actually gone and done it. We're %s champions! Thank you so much for making this happen!
68   =Amazing work to bring us this far, but there's still one more match to win. I can't wait to see us lift that %s trophy, can you?
69   =%s champions! A massive thank you and congratulations!
70   =We're sitting on top of the world! Does it get any better than this? Thank you for everything!
71   =Giving our rivals %s the run around is exactly what the supporters and the club needed. Great result!
72   =Great win, champ! Victory against your bitter rivals %s tastes all the more sweeter, don't you think?
73   =A derby victory in the bag! Sure, %s don't punch at our weight, but beating them always makes my week!
74   =A fine match against a strong opponent in %s. More of the same next time please!
75   =%s are a team we always want to beat, and you made it happen. Top result.
76   =I don't know what it is, but it's just so much more satisfying to beat %s than any other team.
77   =Finally back to winning ways. It would help if this became a habit, you know.
78   =More wins like that and less of those losing streaks, you hear.
79   =Let's build on that win and try to gain some momentum. What we really need is points on the board, got it?
80   =You pulled off the win, but don't think you're out of my bad books just yet. Keep going.
81   =We can all breathe a sigh of relief now the losing streak is over, but you know as well as I do that there's still more work to be done.
82   =Fine work in stringing together a %d-match winning streak in the league. I hope to see this air of positivity around the club continue.
83   =That makes %d wins in a row in the league. I can barely remember a time when I wasn't so cheery. Keep it up!
84   =I hate to jinx this incredible %d-match winning streak in the league, but WOW! We're unstoppable!
85   =It was a shame none of the new boys got a run out in the %s, but I'm sure you know what you're doing.
86   =Finishing as champions of the %s would've been ideal, but it was still an irreplaceable experience that'll serve us well next season.
87   =It was a tough result for the club to miss out on the %s title, but we'll take it as a lesson. Let's shake it off and make sure we pick ourselves up for the next outing.
88   =A defeat in the %s was not the result we were hoping for, but we're guaranteed another bite of the cherry next season. I'm sure you'll take us further next time.
89   =A win in our first %s match would have been great, but there are still plenty of positives we can take away and reflect on.
90   =I'm trying to remember a rougher outing than the one I just witnessed... Nope, I can't.
91   =The %s was our top trophy target, and we're out at the Group stage. Big shame.
92   =We've crashed out at the Quarter-finals of the %s. I just wished we could have grabbed one more win.
93   =One more win and it'd be us in the %s Final. I guess we'll have to pick ourselves up and wait for another chance to come around.
94   =We were so close to winning the %s. I know you're your own harshest critic, so I'll just say thank you for taking us this far, and leave it there.
95   =Ouch. I could almost smell the polish on the %s trophy. Our chance will come though. Let's make sure we're here again next year.
96   =We were so close to winning the %s. I know you're your own harshest critic, so I'll just say thank you for taking us this far, and leave it there.
97   =We were THIS close to being crowned the world's best... Well, you can't win 'em all though, eh?
98   =No matter how good your rivals might be, losing to %s is still a bitter pill to swallow.
99   =I was really looking forward to beating %s in the derby... We'll do 'em next time, eh?
100  =That really wasn't the result I was looking for. If we only win one game all season, make sure it's the derby against %s.
101  =No matter how good they are, losing to %s is never easy to take. Damn.
102  =I hate not beating %s. We need to turn the tables on them next time.
103  =Are we really not good enough to beat %s? I'm still trying to wrap my head around the result...
104  =More points dropped? I'm not happy, and neither should you be.
105  =I'm not interested in hearing your excuses for yet another disappointing result. Just know that my patience has its limits.
106  =Every loss means another uncomfortable meeting with me. You need to fix things and start winning sharpish!
107  =How long do you think I'm going to continue to accept this train wreck of a season? I should just hand you a list of managerless clubs myself!
108  =Another week, another dismal performance. Tell me, which do you think will happen first - you winning or you cleaning out your desk?
109  =We were so close to making it %d wins in a row. Not to worry, I'm sure you'll have us back to winning ways soon enough.
110  =I was really hoping to stretch that winning streak to %d matches. Don't get me wrong, it was a fine run of form. Nice work.
111  =I was really hoping to stretch that winning streak to %d matches. Don't get me wrong, it was a fine run of form. Nice work.
112  =Are you settling into life at the club? I'm hoping for a smashing season from you!
113  =I've only got so much good will. Perhaps it was a mistake to stick with you... It's up to you to prove your worth to this club.
114  =I'm not sure the lads are responding to your leadership any longer. Maybe it's time for a change...
115  =Well, you knew this time would come. All that's left is for me to do is thank you for your hard work and wish you all the best for the future.
116  =I have to say, you've started to turn things around. It's still early days yet, but I'm willing to give you a little more time.
117  =You've shown great bouncebackability recently. Maybe all that talk of letting you go was a bit presumptuous. Maybe...
118  =You remember how I wanted you to win us a title this season? That's still our goal, in case you'd forgotten.
119  =Are you sure we're still on track to win a place in the %s, because recent results say differently.
120  =That place in an international cup I was hoping for looks to be slowly slipping away...
121  =I'm still expecting we finish in the top %d. Are you still able to deliver that?
122  =Making sure we don't get relegated doesn't appear to be your top priority at the moment. Let's change that.
123  =I want to see us promoted for next season. Can you say the same?
124  =Make good use of the transfer window to steer the ship back on course.
125  =It'll take a swift change of fortunes for me to start believing in you again.
126  =This club expects nothing but a victory. No excuses, let's go out there and win!
127  =There's nothing like the taste of victory at the expense of this lot. Let's make sure we get it!
128  =Derbies are tough, and usually tougher than you expect. Stick to the game plan and we'll grab the win!
129  =We've got a full house, boys. Let's win this one for the supporters who came to see thrash this lot!
130  =A loss today means we'll be going home emptyhanded. But a win? A win will mean we've achieved the impossible and earned our rightful place in the history books!
131  =You all know what we have to do today. We work hard and we work as a team - that's how we'll get our names etched on that trophy. Now get out there and play some football!
132  =We should be challenging for trophies every year. I don't care if it's the league, domestic cup or nb, take your pick. Good luck.
133  =We should be challenging for trophies every year. I don't care if it's the league, domestic cup or%s, take your pick. Good luck.
134  =We should be challenging for trophies every year. I don't care if it's the league, domestic cup or AFC Champions League, take your pick. Good luck.
135  =Right, here's my top objective for this season. I want to see a winner's trophy in my office for either the league, domestic cup or nb. Got that?
136  =Right, here's my top objective for this season. I want to see a winner's trophy in my office at the end of the year for either the league, domestic cup or %s. Got that?
137  =Right, here's my top objective for this season. I want to see a winner's trophy in my office at the end of the year for either the league, domestic cup or AFC Champions League. Got that?
138  =Our ability to consistently bring titles home is what makes this a great team. With that in mind, I need you to win %s.
139  =We need you to secure our spot at the %s this year.
140  =Get out your notepad, because here's what I need you to do. Get us in the top %d in the league! Got it?
141  =We're aiming to finish high up the table this year.  Make the top %dfinish a reality for me. Got it?
142  =We need a top-%s finish in the league for this season. I'm counting on you.
143  =Now this is a table position I can really get behind. Dare I dream of some trophies come season's end?
144  =It feels good to kick off the season in good form, doesn't it? Let's see if you can keep this momentum up.
145  =Not a bad start to the season. You might just pull this one off.
146  =I'm not interested in micro-managing things around here. How you get it done is your business. Just finish the season with the title and I'll be all smiles.
147  =We could be a little higher in the table, but hey, it's a long way till the end of the season. You'll turn things around, I'm sure of it.
148  =Listen, moving up in the world is about keeping a sure footing when it really counts. Now, dig in your heels and get us more wins.
149  =With results like these, we'll be seeing our opponents in the rear view mirror soon! Keep your foot on the pedal, chief.
150  =Half the season's behind us, and you're on course to make me a happy owner. Keep it up.
151  =The season can be a real slog sometimes, and not every result can go our way. But that doesn't mean my hunger for the title has waned. Get the job done.
152  =When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Keep it together.
153  =We're halfway through the season, and it isn't looking good. Make good use of the transfer window to steer the ship back on course.
154  =We're almost at the finish line. That title's in the bag, right? Right?
155  =You don't need to hear it from me how important a win this late in the season is. A few victories on the trot could be what takes us to the next level.
156  =Here we are at the tail end of the season. Keep your hand on the wheel and your eye on the prize. Good luck.

157  =The %s is nearly over. Now go get us a berth in the %s.
158  =We have the ability to get ourselves over the top. Now make it happen and get me what I so desperately need.
159  =You don't know how happy it makes me feel to see us in the %s. Thank you.
160  =That was one stellar season you put together. How ever can I thank you?
161  =We missed out on the %s, but now we look to the future. Brush yourself off and get ready for the next match.
162  =Seasons this bad are hard to take when I believed so much in you. Maybe I need to have a think about our future…

163  =Let me be the first to thank you for joining %s. I've got big plans for this club with you at the helm. First up for you though, is the International Champions Cup. Use it as a trial by fire to forge a squad capable of seeing us through the season. Oh, and you can expect a bonus should you win the cup.

164  =I'll be in the stands for today's game. Put in a performance to make this club proud!
165  =A win on such a big stage makes me hold my head high. Fantastic performance out there. Being able to see results like these definitely shows why I brought you to the club.
166  =We played our hearts out there today, it could have been a final! I don't expect I'll be witnessing such a performance again any time soon...or will I?
167  =A tough loss to take. The bitter taste of defeat is not one that I'll forget anytime soon.

168  =I see one of our lads won the World Best Player Award! Tell him from me he's made this club proud.
169  =Winning the %s title should give us the momentum we need to carry us through the length of the season. See it done.
170  =As trophies go, the %s title is up there with the best of them. So do right by this club and win it!
171  =You've done well to get us into the Group stage so far. Let's see you take us even further.
172  =You really pulled one out of the bag to get us into the final. I can't wait to see what else you've got up your sleeve!
173  =Don't forget, we didn't make it all the way to the final by ourselves. Our fans have been with us every step of the way, so we owe it to them to get out there and win.
174  =It makes me proud to see us compete in the International Champions Cup. Sure, it's just the pre-season, but a trophy is a trophy. Go out there and make us champions.
175  =The squad looks like they're in great shape. I bet you could string together 5 wins, right?
176  =I'm on top of the world right now. I tell you, I could quite easily get used to all this winning!
177  =I'd be lying if I said I thought we could string together THIS many wins. But...one more wouldn't do my mood any harm now, would it? Ha ha!
178  =We're in the semis! Great work! You've proved me wrong.
179  =We're in the final! I missed this feeling, you know?
180  =I'll never forget this day as long as I live! Our club's name is being chanted the world over. You made this happen, thank you!
181  =We just missed out on a winning finish. Don't worry, though. You've met my expectations for the season.
182  =You've done me proud to bring us this far. Thank you for getting us into the %s.
183  =Well, you've gone and done it! We're %s champions! The season has been a success, and it's all down to you!
184  =Give yourself a pat on the back. The season was a long one, but you made things happen, and the players definitely look more confident.
185  =It may be just the %s, but we took top place. I'm confident you'll take us to new heights next season.
186  =I can't tell you how miffed I am we didn't finish champions. We had the potential to win it all, and we fell short. *Sigh*
187  =One more win and it'd be us in the Semi-finals. I guess we'll have to pick ourselves up and wait for another chance to come around.
188  =Am I dreaming, or did we just get knocked out before the competition really got started? Are you seriously telling me we didn't make it into the %1$s|?
189  =There goes that %strophy to another team. Are you going to apologise to the fans, or should I?
190  =It stings not getting into the %s, but there's always next time.
191  =In my book, there's no prize for finishing as anything other than champions. That said, you gave it your best. Well done.
192  =No Top-3 finish in the %s is a bitter pill to swallow. That being said, you gave it your best shot. Thank you.
193  =Is this really happening? We didn't finish top in the %s? I don't think I've ever felt more concerned for this club's future.
194  =I believe this club can make it past the Group stage. Don't underestimate how hard it'll be though.
195  =The finals are going to be our toughest test yet. But it's our duty, nay, our destiny to defeat all who stand in our way!
196  =Can you feel that? That's the feeling of being one step from a final. We've come this far, let's not trip up now. I believe in you.
197  =We're champions elect. The crown is ours, we just have to reach out and take it. Get me that title!
198  =For now, concentrate on getting us through the Group stage. Good luck out there!
199  =Victory is so close I can taste it. I don't need to tell you what's at stake here.


200  =This is our toughest Knockout Phase challenge yet. Make sure the boys have got their heads in the right place before they step out on the pitch.
201  =We've a tough spell of matches coming up, but you know what to do. Take one game at a time and we'll get through it.
202  =I want to see us smash this first match. Start as you mean to go on, as they say.
203  =No missteps, you get me? The mark of a true champion is the ability to perform under pressure. Do me proud.
204  =I can't wait to see us crush our third straight opponents.
205  =Stringing together one victory after another is sure to bring the supporters on board with our plans. Keep it up!
206  =I can almost reach out and touch that trophy. But don't let me pile on the pressure any more than you're piling it on yourself! Stay focused, and we'll have that title soon enough.
207  =This is what it's all about--the final. Now go out there and give our loyal fans what they deserve, a championship!
208  =We have what it takes to get into the %s. I know you can get us there.
209  =Progressing into the %s is our top priority. The competition will be fierce when we get there, but I know you can handle it.
210  =The %s was never going to be easy going, but I still believe you can deliver that championship.
211  =You made it happen! We're into the %s. Victory is within our grasp!
212  =Watching this poor form in the %s is unbearable. I want us finishing top, so get to work.
213  =Incredible! We won the International Champions Cup! Congratulations! It's going to feel fantastic trotting out on the pitch as champions next season. Oh, and in case you were wondering, yes, of course I've got some thoughts on the club's future goals! And now I know you're the manager to make things happen!
214  =That's the International Champions Cup over with for another year. Now we have the new season to look forward to, and you know what that means. New heights to aim for! I'll let you know what we're aiming for soon enough.
215  =Let me lay out my master plan for this season. We're going to finish top of the league. That's right. Now get to it.
216  =I'm sure the sting of not getting what you want is a familiar feeling to you as it is to me. Not to worry. Brush yourself off and let's see what you've got for next season.
