215  =F8T

30   =Keep the Backline deep at all times when defending. Once in possession, the team will take the initiative through ball retention.
31   =Select no strategies.
32   =The team piles forward with almost every player joining the attack.
46   =Play a tight backline that can win back possession and play long balls to launch counter attacks.
47   =Pressure the opposition deep in their half and launch quick counters on winning back possession.
48   =Get players to move in a way which suits possession football.
49   =The higher the value, the more the players lay emphasis on ball retention when positioning themselves. On a lower level, they will look to maintaining the team's overall shape. 
50   =The higher the level, the more players tend to spread themselves out when looking to receive passes.
51   =The higher the level, the more frequently the players switch positions.
53   =The higher the level, the more pressure that will be applied by players in advanced positions.
54   =The higher the level, the further up the pitch the defensive line will be.
55   =The higher the level, the more compact the team's overall shape becomes when defending.
56   =The higher the level, the more the players tend to maraud forward when defence turns into attack. Conversely on a lower level, the players will tend to lay more emphasis on retaining possession and will position themselves in such a manner.
57   =The higher the level, the more the players tend to take up advanced positions. This affects the number of players who joins the attack in set pieces.
58   =Players on both flanks stay close to the touchline.
59   =This means that even if the ball is on the other side of the pitch, the player on the flank will stay wide.
60   =The striker will frequently drop into the hole to collect passes.
61   =As he comes back for the ball, his teammates will push forward to fill the space he has created.
62   =The full backs stray from their traditional positions and push into the centre.
63   =This gives the team numbers in the middle of the pitch.
64   =When a player is in possession of the ball on the wing, a teammate will head to the touchline to give them passing options.
65   =Other teammates will then run into the space that has been created.
66   =Both full backs will surge forward while midfielders drop back to cover them.
67   =As the full backs push forward, wingers will move towards the middle.
68   =The priority is to keep passing the ball. Players take up positions to enable possession to be retained.
69   =Players will tend not to try to dash into space behind the opponent's defence.
70   =The aim is to score from crosses.
71   =When a player on the wing has possession, forwards will get into position in front of the goal and wait for the cross.
72   =Certain players will be marked much tighter than usual, with the marker switching depending on the position.
73   =Space tends to open up as players track the opposition player they're marking.
74   =Certain forwards stay in the vicinity of the opposition's box rather than dropping back to help the defence.
75   =When the opponent is pushing forward up the wing, players will group in front of goal.
76   =As players are bunched near the goal, it becomes easier for the attacking team to shoot from far.
77   =The defending team drops back to guard against through balls, leaving more space between individual players and the opponent they are marking.
78   =When a team loses possession, they immediately try to win it back with multiple players putting the player on the ball under pressure.
79   =It demands a lot of stamina.
80   =No Advanced Instructions are currently set. Even if you attempt to trigger them, nothing will happen.
81   =If the designated player goes off the pitch, Tight Marking and Counter Target will be cancelled.
82   =It means that these forwards do not use up energy running back and forward.
83   =As players are no longer tightly marked, it makes it easier to pass the ball to feet.
84   =Designated players will refrain from pushing forward in attack.
85   =Wingers (or wide midfielders when no wingers are present) who stray from their traditional wide positions to play more centrally.
86   =When a false winger comes inside, the full back on the same side will move into advanced positions.
87   =Wide midfielders or wingers drop back to cover defensively when needed.
88   =This does not apply when 5 defenders are on the pitch.
